/**
 * Functions are special relations.
 * 
 * Formally speaking, they are relations (x, y) which are 
 * "right-unique" (there is only one value for a given x)
 * a.k.a. they are "functional" or "partial functions"
 * and
 * "left-total" (there exists a y for every x).
 * 
 * Or, putting it together, there exists exactly one y for
 * each x.
