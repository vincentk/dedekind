/**
 * An attempt to spell out type relationships between algeabraic structures
 * in set theoretical terms.
 * 
 * As a subtype (in java) corresponds to a sub-set (in set theory), we can
 * make statements such as:
 * "Every field is a ring." (field extends ring)
 * or in a sense equivalently
 * "The set of fields is a sub-set of the set of rings."
